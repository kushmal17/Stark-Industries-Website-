                helping the government to develop the Project Rebirth in the 1940s.
                Under the leadership of Howard Stark, Stark Industries also started the Stark Expo, also known as the World Exposition of Tomorrow, an exposition located in New York City,
                bringing together great minds and showcasing new technology.</p>

            <h2 class="section-title">About Us</h2>
            <p class="text">Stark Industries is a multinational industrial company and the largest tech conglomerate in the world. Founded in 1939 by Howard Stark, the elder Stark ran the company from its inception up until his death in 1991, 
            after which Obadiah Stane was appointed interim CEO, with Tony Stark officially assuming the position shortly after at the age of twenty-one.
            Under Stark's control, the company flourished financially for nearly two decades; however, when Stark discovered that Stane was selling their weapons to terrorist groups around the world, 
            such as the Ten Rings, he shut down their lucrative weapons division.Stark further developed his armor to create new models, such as the <b>Iron Man Armor: Mark III</b> and started looking for and destroying stolen Stark tech, which he later discovered Obadiah Stane was selling behind his back. 
            Stark faced Stane, who had created his own suit of armor, and defeated him in battle at the Stark Industries Headquarters.
             In 2010, Stark appointed Pepper Potts as the CEO of Stark Industries.
            In 2012, Stark Industries opened a new base in New York City, building the Stark Tower, which was powered by a new prototype Arc Reactor inside the Tower. 
            Potts also procured permits to build a Tower in Washington, D.C. Later that year, Happy Hogan was hired as head of security at Stark Industries Headquarters.</p>

                  Stark and Vanko used his research on the Tesseract to create the Arc Reactor. The Arc Reactor remained generally inactive until Tony Stark was able to miniaturize it and power his Iron Man armors.</p>

                  Following the Battle of New York, one of these planes, officially designated as S.H.I.E.L.D. 6-1-6 and informally known as the Bus, was given to Phil Coulson by Nick Fury to serve as the flying command center for his team.

                  The Avengers used one of these satellites at the end of the War on HYDRA, where J.A.R.V.I.S. provided an aerial view of the HYDRA Research Base that was run by Baron Strucker. This allowed the Avengers to gain a tactical advantage on their enemies, resulting in the successful retrieval of the Scepter in Strucker's possession.
